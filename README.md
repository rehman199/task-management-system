## Description

Welcome to the Task Management System! This is a Full MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) Stack application designed to help you manage and organize your tasks efficiently. The project consists of both frontend and backend components that work seamlessly together to provide a user-friendly task management experience.

---

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v16.0.0 or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v8.0.0 or higher)

---

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rehman199/task-management-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project root directory:

   ```bash
   cd task-management-system
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies for both the frontend and backend:

   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

---

## Setting Up Environment Variables

1. In the root directory of the `frontend` and `backend` folders, locate the `.env.example` files.

2. Copy the contents of `.env.example` and create a new file named `.env` in respective directories.

3. Paste the copied contents into their respective `.env`.

4. Modify the values in `.env` to match your desired configuration. These environment variables are used for configuring the frontend and backend applications.

---

## Usage

1. Start the development server for both the frontend and backend concurrently:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. Access the frontend application in your web browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

3. Interact with the Task Management System, create tasks, edit them, and enjoy a seamless task management experience.

## Docker Configuration: Running the Application with Docker

The Docker setup for this application is defined in the `docker-compose.yml` file.

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rehman199/task-management-system.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd task-management-system
   ```

3. Create `.env` files for frontend and backend as described in the above environment section.

4. Build and run Docker containers in "task-management-system" directory:

   ```sh
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

   This command will build Docker images for the frontend and backend services and start the containers.

5. Access the Application:

   - Frontend: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
   - Backend API: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

6. Stopping the Containers:

   To stop the running containers, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal where you started the containers. Alternatively, run:

   ```sh
   docker-compose down
   ```

...

## Running Tests

The `tests` directory within the `backend` folder contains all the backend test files.

To run the tests for the backend, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have completed the installation steps mentioned in the main README to install the project dependencies.

2. Navigate to the `backend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

3. Run the Jest tests using the following command:

   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

Jest will automatically discover and execute all the test files within the `tests` directory and provide you with test results and coverage information.
